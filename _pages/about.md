('03) and Ph.D. ('06) degrees from the University of Macau (UM), where he is currently Full Professor at the Faculty of Science and Technology (FST) - Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE); Director at the State-Key Laboratory of Analog and Mixed-Signal VLSI, and Deputy Director (Research) at the Institute of Microelectronics. He was a Clare-Hall Visiting Fellow ('09) of the University of Cambridge, UK. His research focuses are on circuits and systems for wireless and multidisciplinary innovations. He has advised/is advising 60+ graduate students and 20+ researchers (RA/post-doc).</p>
  <p>He co-developed 39 state-of-the-art chips which are reported consecutively at the 2011-2024 IEEE International Solid-State Circuits Conference - ISSCC (Chip Olympics), of which 10 are ISSCC Highlight Papers. His graduates are with universities and companies developing cutting-edge research/products for a wide variety of applications like 5G-NR, precision analog, IoE connectivity and automotive.</p>
  <p>His group pioneered the Intelligent Digital Microfluidic (iDMF) platform and micro-Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (micro-NMR) platform for biological/chemical diagnostics. They led to many multidisciplinary publications in the journals like Nature Communications, Nature PG - Microsystems & Nanoengineering, Scientific Reports, RSC Lab on a Chip, RSC Analyst, ACS Analytical Chemistry, ACS Sensors, Oxford Bioinformatics, Elsevier Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Elsevier Sensors and Actuators. In 2018, the group founded the DigiFluidic Biotech Ltd. for commercializing the iDMF platform for virus screening and food-quality monitoring.</p>
  <p>Prof. Mak has co-authored ~520 publications (11 books/book chapters, ~280 journal papers and ~230 conference papers) and holds 35+ patents (issued/filed). He has delivered >120 lectures as keynotes (PRIME'16, RFID-TA'16, ICAC'19, ICTA'19, APCCAS'21, ICICM'22, ICICM'23), industrial seminars (Qualcomm'17, imec'17) and tutorials/short courses (ISCAS'12, APCCAS'12, VLSI-DAT'15, ACTS'20).</p>
  <p>He is the Editor-in-Chief of the IEEE Solid-State Circuits Letters - SSCL ('24-Present). He was the Editorial Board Member of IEEE Press ('14-'16); Senior Editor of IEEE Journal on Emerging and Selected Topics in Circuits and Systems - JETCAS ('14-'15); Associate Editor of IEEE Journal of Solid-State Circuits - JSSC ('18-'24), IEEE Solid-State Circuits Letters - SSCL ('17-'23), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems I - TCAS-I ('10-'11, '14-'15), IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems II - TCAS-II ('10-'13) and IOP Journal of Semiconductors - JOS ('21-'23); Guest Editor of IEEE RFIC Virtual Journal ('14), JSSC ('18), JETCAS ('18) and IEEE Sensors Journal ('19). For IEEE conferences, he was the TPC Vice Chair of ASP-DAC ('16), TPC Member of ISSCC ('17-'19), ESSCIRC ('16-'17) and A-SSCC ('13-'16, '19).</p>
  <p>He co-received numerous paper awards in leading conferences, e.g. RFIC'21, APCCAS'19, ISSCC-SRP'19, IMCO'19, ISSCC’16, A-SSCC’15, ASQED’13, APCCAS’08, DAC/ISSCC’05, MWSCAS’04 and ASICON'03. He co-received the IEEE/CEDA Outstanding Service Award’17; IEEE CASS Outstanding Young Author Award’10; IEEE CASS Chapter-of-the-Year Award’09; IEEE MGA GOLD Achievement Award’09 and Best Associate Editor of TCAS-II’12-’13. His students received 7 SSCS Predoctoral Achievement Awards.</p>
  <p>Prof. Mak was decorated Macau Honorary Title of Value’05 for scientific merits. He received 7 Macau Science & Technology Awards’12'12'14'16'20'22'22, 6 UM Research/Academic Awards, and the UM FST 30th Anniversary Outstanding Alumni Award'19. He received the Tencent Xplorer Prize'22 and is recognized in 2023 as one of the Top Contributing Authors of ISSCC in the past 70 years (1954-2023).</p>
  <p>Prof. Mak currently leads a team of faculties and students with collaboration across the global (e.g. Chinese Academy of Sciences, Stanford U., Harvard U., U. of Pavia, imec, UC Dublin, INL, IST-ULisboa, Universiti Malaya, UESTC, SUSTech, Shenzhen U., SYSU and XJTU).</p>
